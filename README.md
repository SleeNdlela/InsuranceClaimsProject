# Insurance Claim Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an insurance claim dataset to uncover insights regarding claims processing, fraud detection, and customer behavior. The aim is to leverage statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to drive informed decision-making and improve operational efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features related to insurance claims, including:
- `claim_id`: Unique identifier for each claim
- `policy_id`: Identifier for the insurance policy
- `claim_amount`: Amount claimed
- `claim_date`: Date of the claim

- `policy_type`: Type of insurance policy
- `customer_age`: Age of the customer
- `customer_gender`: Gender of the customer
- Additional features...

## Goals
1. **Data Exploration**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics and identify trends.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that can help improve model performance.
4. **Model Development**: Build predictive models to assess the likelihood of claim approval and detect potential fraud.
5. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to communicate findings and insights effectively.
